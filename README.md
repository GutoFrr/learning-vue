# Vue 3

In this project, I travel through Vue.js docs to learn and practice my skills with the framework. It started as a challange to see if could real learn something from the documentation, and I think it is going pretty well!

## First Steps

If you go to the components folder you'll be able to see the "First Steps" folder. There are stored my first interation with Vue 3, like its basic features and methods.
